#description of the task:ShopEase — Progressive Web Application Frontend Demo

ShopEase is a modern, responsive e-commerce front-end designed as a Progressive Web Application (PWA) demo. It showcases a clean, user-friendly interface for browsing and purchasing popular tech gadgets, specifically:

Smart Watch

Wireless Earbuds

Bluetooth Speaker

Each product is presented with a high-quality image, an Indian Rupee (₹) price tag, and an “Add to Cart” button to simulate shopping interaction. The design uses a flexible grid layout, ensuring smooth display across devices from mobiles to desktops.

This front-end is built with HTML and CSS, requiring no backend, making it perfect for demonstrating PWA capabilities like offline readiness and installability (when extended with service workers and manifests). It focuses on usability and visual appeal while providing a solid foundation for building full-fledged e-commerce PWAs.
